## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

* `NormalizePlatform()` no longer throws an exception for "unsupported" platforms. ([#7])

[#7]: https://github.com/kongregate/asset-bundle-builder/pull/7

## [v0.2.1]

### Added

* `ManifestBundlePath`, `CurrentBuildPlatform`, and `GetManifestBundlePathForTarget()`. ([#6])

[#6]: https://github.com/kongregate/asset-bundle-builder/pull/6

## [v0.2.0]

### Added

* `MergePlatformManifests()` as a more robust way of generating the `AssetBundleDescription` objects after building asset bundles. ([#4])

### Fixed

* Build asset bundles are now placed in folders based on their corresponding `RuntimePlatform`, rather than their `BuildTarget`. ([#4])

### Breaking Changes

* `AssetBundleBuilder.GenerateBundleDescriptions()` has been removed and replaced with `MergePlatformManifests()`. You will need to update your build process to provide the `AssetBundleManifest` for each platform to `MergePlatformManifests()`. This can be done by either directly providing the `AssetBundleManifest` asset for each platform, or providing the path to each platform's manifest bundle. See the "Building Bundle Descriptions" section of the README for more information.
